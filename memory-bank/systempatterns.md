# System Architecture

## Key Patterns

- Documentation-first development
- Contextual inheritance hierarchy
- Auto-generated dependency graphs
- Pattern-driven code completion

## Component Relationships

1. Memory Bank acts as central knowledge base
2. Context Engine processes hierarchical relationships
3. .cursorrules stores learned project intelligence
4. Code Generation uses both for context-aware output

# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Finalizing Memory Bank structure
- Developing auto-documentation system
- Implementing pattern recognition

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Complete core file templates
2. Implement file watchers for auto-updates
3. Develop Mermaid diagram generator
4. Create validation checks for documentation

## Active Decisions

- Using Markdown as primary documentation format
- Mermaid.js for system visualization
- File system-based memory persistence
- NLP-based pattern detection approach

# Development Progress

## Completed

- [x] Established core file structure
- [x] Defined documentation hierarchy
- [x] Created initial technical context
- [x] Outlined system architecture

## Pending

- [ ] Auto-documentation implementation
- [ ] Pattern recognition engine
- [ ] Session persistence mechanism
- [ ] Context validation system

## Known Issues

1. System patterns diagram needs refinement
2. Missing auto-update triggers
3. No versioning for memory bank
4. Incomplete pattern matching rules

# Project Intelligence Journal

## Discovered Patterns

1. Documentation updates follow Mermaid diagram changes
2. User prefers incremental file updates over full rewrites
3. Context validation occurs before code generation
4. Markdown headers trigger pattern recognition

## Implementation Guidelines

- Always maintain backward compatibility in memory format
- Prioritize activeContext.md during session initialization
- Validate diagram syntax before committing changes
- Use atomic updates for documentation files

## Workflow Preferences

1. Present multiple implementation options for major features
2. Verify documentation impact before code changes
3. Maintain versioned backups of memory bank
4. Auto-generate progress checklists from TODOs
