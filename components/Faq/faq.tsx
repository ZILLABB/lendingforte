//         <p>What are the minimum credit requirements to receive a loan?</p>
//         <p>To be eligible for a loan, these are the minimum credit requirements:</p>
//         <ul>
//           <li>Different Lending Forte lending partners have different minimum credit scores.</li>
//           <li>In addition, we may accept applicants with insufficient credit history to produce a credit score.</li>
//           <li>Your credit report should not have any significant changes from the time the rate was offered to you until you sign the promissory note.</li>
//           <li>We consider the amount of debt you have in relation to your income.</li>
//           <li>Different Lending Forte lending partners may or may not review items on your credit report such as bankruptcies or public records.</li>
//           <li>Additional minimum credit requirements may apply depending on the lender with which Lending Forte matches you.</li>
//         </ul>
//         <p>Keep in mind that the credit score received by the lender may differ from the one reported by your credit monitoring services if the monitoring service is using a different credit bureau or scoring method.</p>
