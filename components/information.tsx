        Short-term Loan 14-day APR Range: 2731.07% – 514.29% APR varies per
        state regulations. Failure to make timely payments may result in NSF or
        late fees. If your account becomes severely delinquent, it may be turned
        over to a 3rd party collection agency which could impact your credit
        score. Loans do not automatically renew without prior approval. If you
        renew or “rollover” your loan, your principal balance may not be reduced
        and you will owe additional fees and/or interest.
