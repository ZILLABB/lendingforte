            <strong>Short-term Loan 14-day APR Range:</strong> 2731.07% â€“ 514.29% APR varies per
            state regulations. Failure to make timely payments may result in NSF or
            late fees. If your account becomes severely delinquent, it may be turned
            over to a 3rd party collection agency which could impact your credit
            score. Loans do not automatically renew without prior approval. If you
            renew or "rollover" your loan, your principal balance may not be reduced
            and you will owe additional fees and/or interest.
