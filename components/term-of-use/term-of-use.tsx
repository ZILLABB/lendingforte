            Online Marketplace for Lenders and Other Providers. This Website
            functions as an online marketplace for you to find third party
            lenders and other providers that may be of interest to you. By
            clicking “Submit” or any button indicating acceptance, you are
            certifying that all of the information you have provided is your
            loan request form is true, accurate, and complete. Lenders and
            non-lenders (hereafter “Network Partners”) that participate in our
            network may use specific criteria, or filters, to identity the
            consumers with whom they would like to connect with. The Network
            Partners also specify the prices they will pay us for the
            opportunity to present an offer to a consumer that meets the Network

            Partner, often the highest bidding, accepts your loan request. You
            will then be directed to that Network Partner’s website where they
            may present you an offer for a loan or other products that may be of
            interest to you. If no Network Partner accepts your loan request, we
            may present you with an offer to submit another loan request or an
            offer for a different product. We also may share your contact
            information with third-party marketers and service providers that
            may contact you by email or text message/SMS (please note data and
